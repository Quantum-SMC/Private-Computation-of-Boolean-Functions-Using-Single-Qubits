The GitHub repository contains the implementation codes for a Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation (QSMC) protocol that enables two parties (refered to as Alice and Bob) to compute a wide range of symmetric Boolean functions such as AND, OR, NOR, and more, using a single qubit. Detailed instructions for implementing this SMC protocol are available in the paper entitled "Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation via Single Qubit Rotations." These codes are designed to be executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
